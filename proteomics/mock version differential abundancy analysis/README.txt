README FILE PROTEOMICS DIFFERENTIAL EXPRESSION ANALYSIS MOCK VERSION

a folder containing an Rmd file with code, a knitted Markdown file (.html), mock data, and also folders for data, plots, and results. This mock version folder contains no real data or real results, so this can be shared with anyone to learn how to use my code.

Code for the Maxomod CSF project
Made by Clara Meijs

In this folder:

- /data --> input data for the analyses (proteomics data, clinical data, etc)

- /plots --> plots that are created through the code, all plots are automatically saved to this folder

	- /paper --> a folder in the plots folder that contains the figures that are intended to be used in the paper. They are different from the plots in the main plot folder.

- /results --> output data that is generated through the analyses

- MOCK_Proteomics_MAXOMOD.Rmd --> the file with the code, in RMarkdown format

- MOCK_Proteomics_MAXOMOD.html --> the knitted RMarkdown file, which shows the code and its outputs, as well as some figures. If you just want to look at the code and have no intention of running it on the original data, this is where you should look.
